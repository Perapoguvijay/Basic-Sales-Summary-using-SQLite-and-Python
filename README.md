# Basic-Sales-Summary-using-SQLite-and-Python

# Objective

This project demonstrates how to use SQL inside Python to pull simple sales insights (like total quantity sold and total revenue) from a small SQLite database and visualize the results using Matplotlib.

# Steps of performed 

Created a local SQLite database (sales_data.db) and a table named sales.

Inserted sample sales data (product, quantity, price).

Wrote SQL queries inside Python to calculate:

Total quantity sold

Total revenue per product

Loaded query results into a Pandas DataFrame.

Displayed summary results and plotted a simple bar chart of product revenue

# Learning Outcomes 

Practice connecting SQLite with Python

Run SQL queries inside Jupyter Notebook

Perform simple data analysis

Create and save visualizations
